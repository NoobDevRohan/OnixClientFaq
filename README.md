## The most common questions:
### Will there ever be support for *x* device?
- Onix is not supported on anything other than windows 10/11 64 bit currently. If you ask for/suggest it, people will most likely be toxic to you.

### When I open the client, I get a error saying: "You are attempting to open a file of type 'system file'", why does this happen?
- You downloaded the Onix Client DLL, which is only for use with other injectors. If you don't know what a DLL file is, **don't use it**. You should download the launcher from the [#download](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/852334369061863464) channel, and click "Launch" or "Inject" to use the client. If you want to use Onix with another injector, you may use it. It is not needed for the Onix injectors/launchers as they auto download the DLL.

### My anti virus says Onix is malware. Is this true?
- We can assure you that Onix client is safe. It gets marked as a virus because it injects a DLL into a process. Lots of viruses do the same thing for malicious purposes.
- Onix only injects 1 DLL into 1 process (the Onix DLL -> Minecraft), while DLL injection based viruses inject into every program.

### "This app can't run on your PC"
Check the launcher's file size. (you can do this in file explorer)
- If it's 0 bytes, turn off your antivirus and redownload the launcher.
- If it's **NOT** 0 bytes, you either have a 32-bit installation of Windows or a 32-bit computer.

### How to check if your PC is 32 bit:
Right click the start menu and click "System".

Look at your system type under device specifications.

- If it says "64-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you can use Onix Client.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you need to install the 64-bit version of Windows. We will not be showing you how to do that here, so go do your own research.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, ***x86***-based processor", unfortunately, you can't use Onix Client.
- If your PC is ARM or Qualcomm based, you can't use Onix Client either.

### Is there a way to change/turn off the custom "OnixClient on top!" splash text?
- No, because it's so people know the client is injected properly. It's also useful for support reasons if a person in need of help shows a screenshot of their game.

### When I inject, my game crashes. Why does this happen?
- Your game most likely updated to a version that Onix Client does not currently support. You might also be using an older DLL with the "Custom DLL" option enabled in the launcher/injector. If both of these potential causes aren't the case, you can ask for support on our Discord, either by asking in [#community-support](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/832745413916360806) or [making a support ticket.](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/814277715594838087/892132983065161829) **Please state as much details as possible.**

### Why does it say "as nobody (HOW)" on Discord instead of my Gamertag?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20384051/140652515-1e2330c4-a7ee-48bc-a895-c4a8d27aa2b0.png)
- You need Xbox Console Companion installed in your PC. You can find it on the [Microsoft Store.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-console-companion/9wzdncrfjbd8#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) Afterwards, login to the Console Companion and your Gamertag should show up.
- If you already have the Console Companion installed but it still doesn't show up, log off and log back in.

## Launcher error messages:

### Architecture Error
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/139365553-b57f8306-24de-4b1d-b0c8-5ff4b5fc9c95.png)
- You have a 32-bit version of Minecraft. This could come in the form of "FPS boosting" or "Lag Free" AppX files.

### Solution:
- Uninstall Minecraft and redownload it from the Microsoft Store, which will download the 64-bit version.

### Unsupported Version
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/139366307-d319f1ea-36c3-4978-b8ba-ad3cd891141e.png)
- Like the error message says, you have a version of Minecraft that isn't supported. A full list of supported versions exists in the FAQ.

### Solution:
There are 2 possible solutions, depending on your case.
- If the game recently updated, wait for Onix Client to support your version in a future update.
- Otherwise, switch to a supported version. The FAQ shows you how to do this later on.

### Injection Error
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/139366443-21a01000-36c3-44a0-842e-30030bdf31d5.png)
- An unknown error occurred while injecting Onix Client. This could be due to your antivirus.

### Solution:
- Currently, there is no definite solution for this error. You could make a support ticket on our Discord and we'll try to help you.

### Launch Error (no screenshot, rare error message)
- An unknown error occurred while launching.

### Solution:
- Make sure you have **Minecraft for Windows 10** installed, and;
- Disable your antivirus if you haven't already.
- If you meet both of these conditions, there is no solution to this error.

## How do I get the Onix UI?
[Download it here.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833457218040758272/884252116355526726/onixui.mcpack) Thanks to rice#2532 (aka Riceexe) for stealing HJN's ui.
```
THE UI IS BEING GIVEN AS IS. THERE WILL BE NO UPDATES, NO BUG FIXES, AND NO SUPPORT.
```

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/833457218040758272/884252538449326110/unknown.png)
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/833457218040758272/884252747237568562/unknown.png)

Using the UI on versions 1.17 and above will break the pause menu. You can fix this by putting the [pause menu fixer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/814260749232898058/842613971751665704/PauseMenuFixByRice.mcpack) on top of your active packs, which is also made by Rice.

## If you have any questions, problems, or bugs that you would like to report, you can go over to [#community-support](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/832745413916360806) or [#make-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/814277715594838087) on our Discord server.

# **How can I support the client?**
- You can support us by [becoming a patron.](https://www.patreon.com/onixclient) The perks are listed in the tiers. If you buy a tier, please don't hesitate to open a ticket to get your roles if the bot hasn't already synced them.
![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJ3IjoxOTIwLCJ3ZSI6MX0%3D/patreon-media/p/campaign/6852030/b69c55b3fc4f48f79fcc53614733179c/5.png?token-time=1630713600&token-hash=glY7lJkDdk33dl8dyd5c0bZ5IWGqBE5wuKM7B9gaQxA%3D)

# **How do I download the client?**
- Head over to [#download](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/852334369061863464) and download the launcher. If the launcher doesn't work, try using another injector listed. 
- [Fate Injector](https://github.com/fligger/FateInjector/releases/latest/download/FateInjector.exe), if none of the launchers and injectors worked for you.
   
### **Why are my rainbow modules not synced/in time with each other?**
- Say `.syncrainbow` in chat.

### **Why is the zoom not working with my hotkey?**
Right click the module first (you can do this with any module to enable it). This is not a bug, but a feature that allows Onix to have a zoom out animation if you have zoom animations enabled.

### **How do I remove the client?**
Hold CTRL + L.

### **I want a screenshot of the Onix Launcher/injectors.**
# Injector by Onix:
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/785910725499420696/880842342767161364/unknown.png)
# Onix Launcher:
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/139374739-a69c085f-ce7b-4e17-93d6-0cfdd6437d0f.png)

### **Why is there no DLL in #download?**
This is mostly because there is a major bug with one of the modules that *will* crash your game. You can always find the DLL on GitHub if you need it that badly: [Here](https://github.com/bernarddesfosse/onixclientautoupdate/blob/main/OnixClient.dll?raw=true).

### **Why don't the Potion HUD icons show?**
- One of your packs most likely removed them. Download the hotfix pack [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852320290750726145/874753455418388550/PotionFix.mcpack) and put it at the top of your pack list. This pack may break custom hotbars/XP bars, as it uses the same layer as them.

### **Why does the Onix launcher/injector give me a .NET Framework error when I open it?**
- Make sure both the [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) and [Visual C](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) runtimes are installed, then try to reopen it.

### **When I have render options on, I can't see beds and chests and other blocks.**
- You turned on "Hide Tile Entities".

### **How do I change the theme of my Onix GUI?**
- Say ``.theme`` in chat to reveal the theme editor. To share themes, go to your Onix Client folder and find the file called ``theme.txt``. To use a theme made by someone else, make sure Minecraft is closed, then delete the ``theme.txt`` file from the Onix folder (``%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState\OnixClient\``) and replace it with your desired theme. There isn't a theme manager like the config one (.config) and there probably never will be because Onix doesn't want to make it.

### **How do I reset a color/module?**
-Middle click the change color button or the module in the Onix GUI. You can middle click by pressing the scroll wheel down, or clicking with 3 fingers on a trackpad.


### How do I remove the red arrow from minecraft?

Download [this pack](http://www.mediafire.com/file/kqyjo9s9ld39nkn/No+Red+Arrow+by+Mhavin.mcpack/file) 
and apply it. The reason why it exists is because the pack maker/porter of one of your packs never updated hud_screen.json. [The bug report and discussion can be found here.](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-105882)

have a good rest of your life

### **My antivirus blocks the client.**
- Depending on the antivirus that you're using, you should either turn it off so you can download the client or you can exclude the client from being flagged. Onix Client is not a virus of any sort. The launcher is open source; the source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/notcarlton/OnixLauncher) if you want to compile it yourself or check if the code is safe.
